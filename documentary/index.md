# ÀLaMode

%NPM: alamode%

_ÀLaMode_ is  a RegExp-based transpiler of source code in Node.JS. It is a fast, low-weight alternative to AST-based transpilers, such as `@babel`. At the moment, it supports transpilation of `import` and `export` statements which also improves JSDoc support compared to _Babel_ which is an enemy of JSDoc.

```
yarn add -DE alamode
